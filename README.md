Here, you can find the code for the conference paper 'Real-Time Multi-Contact Model Predictive Control via ADMM' that was presented in ICRA2022 and also the code for the extended version of the paper that is being submitted to T-RO (in-progress, will be up soon).

# Extended Version
(soon) Submitted to T-RO

The code is written in C++ and is at least 2-3x faster than the conference version. Reference to code: https://github.com/DAIRLab/dairlib/blob/admm/solvers/c3.h (detailed explanation incoming)
